            <strong>1.</strong> Logistics management is the part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward,
            and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption in
            order to meet customer's requirements.

        <div class="border border-warning p-2 md-2 rounded-4 mt-2">
          <strong>2.</strong> The appreciation of the scope and importance of logistics and the supply chain has led to a more scientific approach being adoptedtowards
          the subject. This approach has been aimed at the overall concept of the logistics function as a whole and also at the individual sub-systems.
          Much of this approach has addressed the need for, and means of, planning logistics and the supply chain, but has also considered some of the
          major operational issues.

            <strong>3.</strong> Logistics refers to the management of the flow of goods and services between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet
          the requirements of customers. Logistics involves the integration of information, transportation, inventory, warehousing, material handling,
          and packaging, and occasionally security. Logistics is a channel of the supply chain which adds the value of time and place utility.
          Today the complexity of production logistics can be modeled, analyzed, visualized and optimized by plant simulation software.
